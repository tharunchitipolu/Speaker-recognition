# Speaker-recognition
Digital Signal Processing course project:

Speaker recognition is the process of automatically recognizing who is speaking using
speaker-specific information in speech waves. There are many applications to Speaker Recognition like secure access control by voice, indexing or labeling speakers in recorded conversations or dialogues, surveillance, and criminal andforensic investigations involving recorded voice samples, voice dialing, etc.
In this project, the Vector Quantization approach will be used due to ease of implementation and high accuracy. Vector Quantization is a process of mapping vectors from a large vector space to a finite number of regions in that space. Each region is called a clusterand can be represented by its center called a codeword. The collection of all codewords is called a codebook.
